## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Dynamic Paragraph

Through the project we were able to figure out correlations through the different datasets and understand what they mean. Through the student alcohol data, we were able to see through the different variables that were calculated, such as age, absences, and grades, that student that drink more tend to do worse in their classes and are absent more.  Through the alcohol life expectancy, we can see, again through variables like beers, spirits, wine, and mean amount of alcohol (in liters), that there is a correlation between life expectancy and alcohol and the more people drink the lower their life expectancy gets. Finally, the happiness and alcohol consumption data told us that there is little to no correlation between the two, and that the two do not have an impact on each other.
