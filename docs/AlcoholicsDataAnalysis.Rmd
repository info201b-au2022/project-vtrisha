## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r chart1, echo=FALSE}
source("../source/Chart-1.R")
alcohol_vs_happiness_scatterplot+ labs(x = 'Total Alcohol Consumption Per Capita (Beer, Spirits, Wine)', y = 'Happiness Score', title = 'Alcohol Consumption By Country vs Happiness Score')
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
This first chart shows a relationship between total alcohol consumption per capita versus the "Happiness Score" of any given country.
There's no easy way to say this, but there's absolutely no relation between happiness and alcohol consumption. With a scatter plot it's easiest to see; you can say that there's a slow rising trend in happiness, but considering there are many other factors such as GDP per capita and ability to actually buy alcohol there's absolutely no relation between alcohol consumption and happiness score. The happiest countries are (usually) those with the most money, and thereby the ability to afford more alcohol to consume.

```{r chart2, echo=FALSE}
source("../source/Chart-2.R")
life_expectancy_vs_alcohol_consumption + labs(x = 'Life Expectancy by Country', y = 'Total Pure Alcohol Consumption (in Liters)', title = 'Mapping Life Expectancy vs Total Alcohol Consumption in Liters by Country')
```
This chart once again shows, albeit inadvertently, a trend that we will come to hate. The fact that there are more factors than we can actually definitively study and draw a conclusion from that are affecting our perception of this chart. There are a variety of reasons why a country like Spain would have such high alcohol use while still having a high life expectancy, from cultural reasons as well as population statistics and even the quality of their healthcare. However, there is something important to note here: countries with incredibly high level of alcohol consumption, in excess of 11 liters, are not those with the highest life expectancy. Countries like Lithuania, Belarus, Grenada, these countries can have the best healthcare in the world and that still cannot fight the disastrous effects of alcohol use longterm. 

```{r chart3, echo=FALSE}
source("../source/Chart-3.R")
distribution_of_alcohol_use + labs(x = 'Amount of drinks consumed weekly', y = 'Distribution of students', title = "Students and their weekly drinking habits") + theme_light()
```

This bar chart shows the distribution of students to how much they had to drink in any single week. This chart specifically shows that a common facet of cultural assumption, high schoolers drinking at an increased level compared to adults, is unfounded. This helps us to understand that the majority of students are not naturally alcoholics by circumstance of being students, and there are other factors that come into play when it comes to alcoholism rooting itself in students in high school.
=======
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Dynamic Paragraph

Through the project we were able to figure out correlations through the different datasets and understand what they mean. Through the student alcohol data, we were able to see through the different variables that were calculated, such as age, absences, and grades, that student that drink more tend to do worse in their classes and are absent more.  Through the alcohol life expectancy, we can see, again through variables like beers, spirits, wine, and mean amount of alcohol (in liters), that there is a correlation between life expectancy and alcohol and the more people drink the lower their life expectancy gets. Finally, the happiness and alcohol consumption data told us that there is little to no correlation between the two, and that the two do not have an impact on each other.
